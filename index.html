<h2>You can always count on me when in doubt about some code or program! Let's look at it together!</h2>  

I'm an enthusastic and empathic co-worker who's always in for a challenge! 

<h2>Here is a funny story</h2> 

<p>When i was in the 4th grade we were supposed to do homework in group once. It was about writing some poem. My friend and I made it in the garden of the school 5 minutes before class, of course.
Once it was finally finished we rushed over the campus to be on time, homework in my hand, lost it in the wind and the homework flew away.
We still laugh with it until now. The teacher never believed us. </p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2> 

<p>When my homework flew away</p>
